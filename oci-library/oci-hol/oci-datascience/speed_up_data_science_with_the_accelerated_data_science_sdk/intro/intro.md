# Data Science Service

## Introduction

* Provides infrastructure and data science tools, such as open source technologies, libraries, and packages for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It also offers Oracle ML products, such as Oracle Labs AutoML and model explanation tools.

* Provides data scientists with a collaborative and project-driven workspace that includes an end-to-end cohesive user experience and supports the life cycle of predictive models.

* Helps data scientists concentrate on methodology and domain expertise to deliver more models to production in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

## Data Science Service Concepts

Review the following concepts and terms to help you get started with Data Science.

* Project: Projects are collaborative workspaces for organizing and documenting Data Science assets such as notebook sessions and models.

* Notebook Session: Data Science notebook sessions are interactive coding environments for building and training models. Notebook sessions come with many pre-installed open source and Oracle developed machine learning and data science packages.

* Accelerated Data Science SDK: The Oracle Accelerated Data Science (ADS) SDK is a Python library that is included as part of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service. ADS has many functions and objects that automate or simplify many of the steps in the Data Science workflow, including connecting to data, exploring and visualizing data, training a model with AutoML, evaluating models, and explaining models. In addition, ADS provides a simple interface to access the Data Science service model catalog and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services including Object Storage. To familiarize yourself with ADS, see the Accelerated Data Science Library.

* Model: Models define a mathematical representation of your data and business processes. The model catalog is a place to store, track, share, and manage models.
