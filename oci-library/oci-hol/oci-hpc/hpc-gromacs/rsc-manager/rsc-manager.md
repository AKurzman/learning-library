## **Resource Manager**

In the OCI console, there is a Resource Manager available that will create all the resources needed. The region in which you create the stack will be the region in which it is deployed.

1. Select the menu ![](./images/menu.png) on the top left, then select Resource Manager --> Stacks. Choose the Name and Compartment on the left filter menu where the stack will be run.

2. Create a new stack: ![](./images/stack.png)

3. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-gromacs/tree/master/Resources/gromacs-2020.1.zip) for terraform scripts and upload it into the stack.

Move to the [Select Variables](https://github.com/oci-hpc/oci-hpc-runbook-gromacs/blob/master/Documentation/ResourceManager.md#select-variables) section to complete configuration of the stack.
