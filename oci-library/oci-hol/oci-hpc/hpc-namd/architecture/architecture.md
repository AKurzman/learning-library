## **Architecture**

The architecture for this runbook is simple, a single machine running inside of an OCI VCN with a public subnet.
Since a GPU instance is used, block storage is attached to the instance and installed with the NAMD application. The instance is located in a public subnet and assigned a public ip, which can be accessed via ssh.
