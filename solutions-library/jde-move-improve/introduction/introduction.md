# JDE Trial Edition on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Workshop
# Introduction

## Workshop Objectives

This workshop will demonstrate how to deploy JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Release 9.2 Trial Edition to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) 

Upon completion of this workshop, you will have a working deployment of JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Trial Edition with Tools Release 9.2 and Applications Release 9.2 on fully functional suite servers deployed on a single Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute instance 

Trial Edition is for training and demonstration purposes only. It can be used to verify functionality and to investigate proofs of concept (POCs). The Trial Edition on OCI Compute contains only the Pristine (PS920) environment, which is one of the four standard JD Edwards EnterpriseOne environments
