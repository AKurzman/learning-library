steps to get giong with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud.

Estimated Lab Time: &lt;120&gt; minutes 

### About Product/Technology

Micronaut is an innovative new server side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications
