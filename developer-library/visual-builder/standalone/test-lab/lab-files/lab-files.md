# Import Data to an Oracle Visual Builder Mobile Application

## Before You Begin

- This tutorial shows you how to add data to a mobile application.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes

### Background

In Oracle Visual Builder, you can populate your business objects by importing data from a file.

### What Do You Need?

- Access to Visual Builder's user interface
- A supported browser
- Completion of the previous tutorials
- An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account

## **STEP 1**: Import Data for the Department Business Object

1. Right-click [this file](<files/Department.csv>) and download it to your file system. The Department.csv file contains six departments for the application.

2. In the Navigator, click **Business Objects**.

3. Click **Department**, then click the **Data** tab. The business object fields you created are displayed.

4. Click **Import From File**. ![Arrow icon](<images/vbcsnd_mob-import_icon_transp.png>)

5. In the Import Data dialog box, select the **Replace** option for Row Handline if it's not already selected. then click the upload box.

6. Click **Close** after the file has been successfully imported.

## Everything below here is to be ignored

To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

Download the [starter file](<files/starter-file.sql>) SQL code.

*Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](<https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm>)*

2. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](<images/sample1.png> "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

    ![Image alt text](<images/sample1.png>)

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](<images/sample2.png>) click **Navigation**.

5. One example with bold **text**.

    If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.


## **STEP 2:** title

1. Sub step 1

    Use tables sparingly:

    \| Column 1 \| Column 2 \| Column 3 \| \| --- \| --- \| --- \| \| 1 \| Some text or a link \| More text \| \| 2 \|Some text or a link \| More text \| \| 3 \| Some text or a link \| More text \|

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent by at three spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2



3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
    Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
    <copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy&gt;</copy&gt;.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

    ```
    <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file&gt;</copy>
    ```


*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:* You may now [proceed to the next lab](<#next>).
