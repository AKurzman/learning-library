## Deploy Micronaut Application to OCI


### Deploy (From Local To VM)

1. Before deploying, ensure the wallet exists on the VM by running the snippet produced by `setup.sh` that looks similar to:

   ```shell script
   # run on local machine to push to VM
   scp -i ~/.ssh/id_oci -r /tmp/wallet opc@[VM IP Address]:/tmp/wallet
   ```

1. Build JAR with:

   ```shell script
   # run on local machine
   ./gradlew assemble
   ```

1. Push JAR to VM with the snippet produced by `setup.sh` that looks similar to this:

   ```shell script
   # run on local machine to push to VM
   scp -i ~/.ssh/id_oci -r build/libs/micronaut-data-jdbc-graal-atp-0.1-all.jar opc@[VM IP Address]:/app
   ```

1. To run on the VM, SSH in and run the snippet generated by `setup.md` that looks similar to this:

   ```shell script
   # run on VM to start application
   java -jar -DMICRONAUT_OCI_DEMO_PASSWORD [your generated password] /app/micronaut-data-jdbc-graal-atp-0.1-all.jar
   ```
