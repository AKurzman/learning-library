## About this Workshop

Based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test DB Security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle DB Security PMs Team.

Now, **you no longer need important resources on your PC** (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, **making you completely autonomous to discover** at your rhythm all new DB Security features, but also you can even now **make your own live demonstration** in front of your customers.

In this workshop, you will find details of the use cases and scenarios that we put at your disposal so that you can discover and learn more about Oracle DB Security solutions.

The complete architecture of the DB Security Hands-On Labs is composed of 4 VMs as below:

- DBSec-Lab VM (*Mandatory for all labs: Baseline and Advanced workshops*)
- AV Server VM (*for Advanced workshop only*)
- DBF Server VM (*for Advanced workshop only*)

During this 1st workshop, you'll use different resources to interact with these VMs:
- SSH Terminal Client;
- SQL Developer;
- Glassfish HR App;
- Oracle Enterprise Manager 13c;

So that your experience of this workshop is the best possible, DO NOT FORGET to perform lab "*Initialze and Start the DBSecLab Environment*" to be sure that all these resources are correctly set!
