# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the **Oracle Big Data Service (BDS)**.

## What is Oracle Big Data Service?
Oracle Big Data Service is a platform cloud service specifically designed for a diverse set of big data use cases and workloads. From short-lived clusters used to tackle specific tasks to long-lived clusters that manage large data lakes, Big Data Service scales to meet an organizationâ€™s requirements at a low cost and with the highest levels of security.

* Vertically integrated for Hadoop, Kafka, and Spark using Cloudera Enterprise Data Hub.
* Highly secure and highly available clusters provisioned in minutes.
* Expand on premise Hadoop; deploy test and development to the cloud.
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
* End-to-end data management; use with Autonomous Database, Analytics Cloud, OCI Streaming, OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Science, and OCI Data Flow.
* Use Oracle SQL to query across Hadoop, Object Stores, Kafka, and NoSQL with Cloud SQL ???  which includes Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph, Big Data Connectors, and Oracle Data Integrator.
