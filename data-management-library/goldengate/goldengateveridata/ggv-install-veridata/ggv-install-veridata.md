# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using **Oracle GoldenGate Veridata**.

## What is Oracle GoldenGate Veridata?
Oracle GoldenGate Veridata compares a source (original, or trusted) set of data with a target (secondary) set of data to identify discrepancies. By accounting for data that is being replicated while a comparison takes place, Oracle GoldenGate Veridata can run concurrently with data transactions and replication, while still producing an accurate comparison report.
With Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, you can:
* Compare data accurately while transactional and replication operations are taking place
* Configure workflow objects, such as connections, groups, compare pairs, profiles, and jobs
* Monitor Jobs and repair out-of-sync jobs
* Any scale using high performance bare metal or cost effective virtual machine (VM) shapes.
