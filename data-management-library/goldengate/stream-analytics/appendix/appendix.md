# Appendix

## Introduction
This appendix is a supplementary aid to the labs for GGSA Workshop primarily for Lab 3 creating the **RetailPromotions** pipeline.  You can refer to this section of the workshop when performing the labs.  Not every screen shot has been captured in this appendix but you can look at the following image and verify the structure of your pipeline.  In that regard each stage that does have a screen shot has been labeled accordingly.
