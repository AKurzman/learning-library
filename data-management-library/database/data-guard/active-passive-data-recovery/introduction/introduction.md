# Introduction: Active and Passive Disaster Recovery

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, we'll take an in-depth look into the disaster recovery (DR) solutions that are leveraged by Oracle's customers. These solutions will cover the discussion around disaster recovery at both the application and database levels.

Estimated Lab Time: 3 - 4 hours

### About Disaster Recovery

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides highly available, secure and scalable infrastructure and services that enable quick, reliable and secure recovery of cloud workloads. In order to build a comprehensive plan that guarantees recovery of your applications after a disaster, one must plan for all possible scenarios that can cause disasters at every layer of an application.

### **Objectives**
In this workshop, you will:
- Leverage Rsync to sync application files between the primary and DR servers
- Set up DR failover using Oracle Data Guard through the OCI console as well as through manual configurations.
- Simulate DR for solution verification.

### Prerequisites 

* Download and unzip the [Terraform zip file](TBD) onto your local machine.

You may proceed to the first lab.
