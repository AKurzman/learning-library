# Using Database Property Graph features in a Docker environment 

## Introduction

In this workshop you will work with Docker images for an Oracle Database and deploy the Oracle Property Graph Server and Client components into a Linux Docker image.  
Next you will load data, create a graph, and query and analyze the graph and visualize query results. The data consists of information about customers, their social network, their accounts, their purchases, and the stores where they made these purchases.  

### About Oracle Property Graph 
Property graphs have become a useful way to model, manage, query and analyze much of the connected data found in todayâ€™s applications and information systems.  They allow you to represent data based on relationships and connectivity, query data by traversing those connections, and analyze data using algorithms that evaluate the strength of the connections, patterns and anomalies in the graph, the importance of elements in the graph, and other factors.

Oracle Database property graph support consists of graph storage, indexing, and search; a powerful in-memory analyst with 50 built-in, parallel analytic functions; a graph query language and developer APIs. Graph algorithms enable you to explore and discover relationships in social networks, IoT, big data, data warehouses and complex transaction data for applications such as fraud detection in banking, customer 360, and smart manufacturing.

## Workshop Objectives

In this workshop you will:  
- Setup an Oracle Linux Docker image and deploy the Property Graph Server and Clent components
- Load a graph from files and query and analyze it
- Setup an Oracle Database Docker image
- Load data into the database 
- Create a graph representation of that data
- Query and analyze the graph
- Visualize graph query results

## Lab Breakdown
- **Lab 1:** Deploy the Graph Server and Client components in a Docker Oracle Linux image.
- **Lab 2:** Load a graph from files. Query, analyze, visualize results.
