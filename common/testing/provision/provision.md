## Introduction

*Describe the lab in one or two sentences, for example:* This lab walks you through the steps to ...

Estimated Lab Time: &lt;n&gt; minutes


*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## **STEP 1**: Conditional Text Test

Step 1 opening paragraph.

1. **Conditional content test:** Select your compartment. <if type="livelabs">**LiveLabs only:** If you are using a LiveLabs environment, be sure to select the compartment provided by the environment. Leave Always Free unchecked,</if><if type="freetier">**FreeTier Only:** Choose any compartment, select "Always Free",</if> and enter `SecretPassw0rd` for the ADMIN password, then click **Create Autonomous Database**.

    <!-- comment -->

    ![](images/atp-settings-1.png " ")
    <if type="livelabs">![](images/atp-settings-2-notaf.png " ")</if>
    <if type="freetier">![](images/atp-settings-2.png " ")</if>
    ![](images/atp-settings-3.png " ")

<if type="livelabs">
2. Steps 2 - 4 are for **LiveLabs** only. This test will show if the numbering is modified automatically. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png " ")

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.
</if>

5. This step should be 2 if type is not `livelabs`. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

6. Links to external files

   To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

   Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

   *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

## **STEP 2:** Code samples with variables

1. Code examples - test pattern for `< and >` characters

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a <variable> using the less-than and greater-than symbols</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Not included in the copy: <copy>This code example contains a &lt;variable&gt; that uses the escaped characters</copy>
    ```

## **STEP 3**: Images

1. Sample inline image that is 100 x 100 pixels ![100x100](images/sample3.png) (max size for an in-line image)

2. Image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. 1200 pixel wide Image with a title.

    ![Image alt text](images/cloud-login.png " ")

3. 1200 pixel wide Image without a title (no " ")

    ![Image alt text](images/cloud-login.png)

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may proceed to the next lab.
