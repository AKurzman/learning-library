# Workshop Introduction and Overview                                    

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to **develop labs and workshops**

## What are Live Labs and Workshops
A lab is a new model adopted by the DB organization to enhance the tutorial experience. Labs are what we all commonly know as Oracle by example (OBE). Labs can be combined to form a workshop, formerly known as learning path.

An individual Markdown (.md) file is called a lab (previously known as an Oracle By Example or OBE, or a tutorial).
A collection of labs is called workshop (previously known as Hands-on Lab or HOL, or a Learning Path).

## GitHub Projects and repositories
* GitHub is organized by projects.
* Each project has its own repository (commonly referred to as repo) that is accessed
through a unique URL.
