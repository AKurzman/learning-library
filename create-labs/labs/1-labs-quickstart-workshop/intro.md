# Lab1: Introduction to Labs and Workshops                                   

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to **develop labs and workshops**

## What are Labs and Workshops
A lab is a new model adopted by the DB organization to enhance the tutorial experience. Labs are what we all commonly know as Oracle by example (OBE). Labs (also called Livelabs) can be combined to form a workshop, formerly known as Hands-on Lab or HOL, or a Learning Path.

An individual Markdown (.md) file is called a lab.
A collection of labs is called workshop.

## GitHub Projects and Repositories
* GitHub is organized by projects.
* Each project has its own repository (commonly referred to as repo) that is accessed
through a unique URL.

## GitHub Workflow
The following flow chart shows the process that your need to follow to set up the environment for developing labs and workshops.

The following diagram explains the process of setting up the GitHub environment, creating a forked (duplicate) copy of the production oracle/learning-library repository to your GitHub account, and cloning your forked repository to your local machine.
