# Welcome to the Creating Live Labs and Workshops!

The **Getting Started with Oracle Big Data Service (BDS) workshop** is a series of step-by-step labs that guide you through the process of setting up a simple environment and creating a small BDS cluster. You'll also explore with adding Cloud SQL to the cluster, accessing the cluster from the public internet, using Cloudera Manager and Hue to access the cluster, and creating a Hadoop administrator user.
